This chart brings all of our data together in one graphic. Based on a typical medium-sized room (78 m<sup>3</sup>), this chart asks: <ul><li>How many rooms full of clean air can this device buy for the cost of a dollar (left to right, where right is better)</li><li>How many rooms full of clean air can this device provide per hour (bottom to top, where top is better)</li><li>How noisy is the device (yellow to black, where yellow is better)</li></ul> The cost includes the upfront cost (spread over 5 years) plus the expected ongoing costs of electricity and filter replacements.
